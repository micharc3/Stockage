<a><i><b>About me</b></i></a></center>
- I'm French and I was born in 1999.
- I started watching anime seriously in 2015? (still in debate) thanks to [this guy ](https://anilist.co/user/kaiserkueche/) but I was already watching [One Piece ](https://anilist.co/anime/21/ONE-PIECE/) almost every day on TV when I was in middle school.
- I don't really know what my first anime is since I watched TV a lot when I was a child and remember seeing episodes of many different anime but my first manga is [Pandora Hearts](https://anilist.co/manga/33031/Pandora-Hearts/).
- I don't rate anymore because I'm lazy and didn't pick any favorite characters because I feel like there would be too much. If you want to know what I think about something in my list feel free to ask and I'll gladly talk about it (if my memory allows it).
- Beside anime/manga I like music, chess, video games, films, boardgames and some other things.
