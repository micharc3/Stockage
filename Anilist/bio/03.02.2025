French guy born in 1999.
I started watching anime in 2015 thanks to [this guy](https://anilist.co/user/kaiserkueche/).
I don't rate anymore because I'm lazy, I didn't pick any favorite character because I feel like there would be too much.
If you want to know what I think about something in my list feel free to ask I'll gladly talk about it (if my memory allows it).
Besides anime/manga I like music, chess, video games, boardgames, films and some other things.
